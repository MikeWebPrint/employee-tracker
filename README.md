  ## Features
  
  This project features a command line interface using Inquirer prompts to trigger SQL queries against a local MySQL database connection.  Results are displayed in console tables. This app is designed to operate all of the expected CRUD functions. At the time of submission, I have been successful in the Create and Read functions.

  ## Tests
  
  Testing for this project should include verifying all the basic CRUD functions: create, read, update, and delete.  Is a department, role, or employee added to the database as expected?  Is the data modified or deleted as prompted? Does the data persist?
